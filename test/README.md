# Shell's Tests

Still being worked on, in the meantime here are some quick and dirty instructions:

To set up:

- `cd test`
- `npm install`
- `grunt` *runs the default tasks and performs a watch on certain tasks, and makes the site available on <http://localhost:9000>*
- `grunt build` *runs the build tasks, final destination is the `dist/` folder*
- `grunt deploy` *runs the build tasks then deploys `dist/` folder to a GitHub Pages URL: <http://campaignmonitor.github.io/shell>*
