# What is Shell?

*Hold on to your hats, a docs website is in the works*, in the meantime Shell's
code is heavily documented.

In a nutshell this is Campaign Monitor's (CM) CSS Library that allows CM to build UI a lot faster and more consistently, plus makes our UI more robust and maintainable.

**☞ Shell is not at MAJOR version 1—very soon it will be, until then anything may change at any time therefore the library should not be considered stable ([see](http://semver.org/#spec-item-4)) ☜**

Feedback is welcome via [Issues](https://github.com/campaignmonitor/shell/issues).
