# What is Shell?

*Hold on to your hats, a docs website is in the works*, in the meantime Shell's
code is heavily documented.

In a nutshell this is Campaign Monitor's (CM) CSS Library that allows CM to build UI a lot faster and more consistently, plus makes our UI more robust and maintainable.


# Dependencies

- [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/install) (either [Ruby](http://rubyinstaller.org/) or [LibSass](http://libsass.org/))
- [Autoprefixer](https://github.com/postcss/autoprefixer)

    > [PostCSS](https://github.com/postcss/postcss) plugin to parse CSS and add vendor prefixes to CSS rules using values from [Can I Use](http://caniuse.com/).

    *We advise you to setup Autoprefixer as part of your build process. If
    you're using [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/), you can create a Grunt task
    for Autoprefixer using a PostCSS plugin, [see](https://github.com/postcss/autoprefixer#grunt)*.
