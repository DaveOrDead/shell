**⚠ Shell is very close to reaching version 1, until then bugs are likely, our advice; until version 1 don't use Shell for anything going to production. ⚠**

# What is Shell?

*Hold on to your hats, a docs website is in the works*, in the meantime Shell's

In a nutshell this is Campaign Monitor's (CM) CSS Library that allows CM to build UI a lot faster and more consistently, plus makes our UI more robust and maintainable.

Feedback is welcome via [Issues](https://github.com/campaignmonitor/shell/issues).
