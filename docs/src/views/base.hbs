These styles are applied at the most global level being applied via element selectors, except for “Headings” which are scoped to classes (see that section for the info).</p><p>Everything in Base needs to be easily overridden which is really easy to do as everything in Base sits right at the bottom in terms of specificity.</p>"}}
